/**
 * You'll be given an array of integer that represent a chart. Array index
 * is an x coordinate, and array value is a y coordinate. Your job is to
 * determine all the peaks in the graph. Peak is a point where previous value
 * and next value (if both exist) is lower than the point itself.
 *
 * Sample input: [1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 1]
 * Sample output: [5, 3, 5] // 3 peaks
 * Visualization:
